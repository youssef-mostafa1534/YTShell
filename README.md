# YTShell

YTShell is a modern and customizable shell inspired by [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/). Built entirely in Python, YTShell combines the flexibility of Python scripting with powerful features from tools like [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide). Whether you're a power user or just looking for a simpler shell experience, YTShell offers an easy-to-customize environment to suit your needs.

## Features

- **Inspired by Zsh**: YTShell takes inspiration from the powerful features and customization options of Zsh, offering a familiar experience with the added benefits of Python scripting.
- **Easy Customization**: Easily customize colors and add your own commands by editing simple configuration files.
- **Auto complete cd commands**: YTShell eases directory navigation by remembering the directories you've visited, so you can use the cd command and only type 1 word of the path you want to visit and it will take you there.
- **Python-Based**: YTShell is made entirely in Python, allowing for easy extension and modification.

### **Planned features**:
- Returning to previous commands using the up arrow key
- Going back while typing prompt using the left arror key
- Adding a "clear" shortcut (Ctrl+L)
- Adding more commands, by listening to your suggestions ðŸ¤—

## Customizing YTShell

YTShell is designed to be highly customizable, allowing you to personalize the look and feel of your shell environment. This can be done through the `theme` and `config` commands.

### `theme` Command

The `theme` command allows you to customize the appearance of YTShell, including colors for different elements like the prompt, time, and status messages.

#### Usage:

- **View Current Theme**: 
  To display the current theme settings, simply run:
  
  ```bash
  theme
  ```

- **Edit Theme**: 
  To customize the theme, use the `-edit` flag followed by the colors you want to set for various elements. The color values should be provided in the following order:
  
  1. `prompt-bg`: Background color of the prompt
  2. `prompt-txt`: Text color of the prompt
  3. `time-bg`: Background color of the time display
  4. `time-txt`: Text color of the time display
  5. `stat-bg`: Background color of the status message
  6. `stat-txt`: Text color of the status message
  7. `stat-err-bg`: Background color of error messages
  8. `stat-err-txt`: Text color of error messages
  
  Example:
  
  ```bash
  theme -edit black white green yellow blue red cyan magenta
  ```
  **Available colors:**
  black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white,
  light_grey, dark_grey, light_red, light_green, light_yellow, light_blue,
  light_magenta, light_cyan.

  
  This command sets the colors for the prompt, time, and status messages according to the provided values.

### `config` Command

The `config` command allows you to configure various operational settings for YTShell, such as time display and prompt character.

#### Usage:

- **View Current Configuration**:
  To display the current configuration settings, simply run:
  
  ```bash
  config
  ```

- **Edit Configuration**:
  To customize the configuration, use the `-edit` flag followed by the settings you want to modify. The settings should be provided in the following order:
  
  1. `time`: Display time in the prompt (`true` or `false`)
  2. `timeFormat`: Format of the time display (e.g. `%H:%M:%S-%d/%m/%y`)
  3. `promptChar`: The character used as the prompt symbol
  
  Example:
  
  ```bash
  config -edit true 24h $
  ```
  
  This command enables the time display in 24-hour format and sets the prompt symbol to `$`.

### Notes

- Ensure that you provide valid values when using the `-edit` flag with either command.
- If you encounter errors, double-check the arguments youâ€™ve provided.
